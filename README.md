## Centuries of Fun

**CONNECT IV** is a two player game wherein the objective is to connect four of your pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while preventing your opponent from doing the same!

In this version take on the role of the _Patricians_ in their ancient game of _wit_ and _leisure_.
